WT - Well Tested Module, meaning it's been through enough consecutive Porcu Training Bombs and Centurions to warrant being correct in the field

Widgets - Adding/Subtracting ports is clean. Can easily set Indicators back to UNKNOWN. TextFields can
        accept letters, but don't register within the data. Souvenir and ForgetMeNot tabs controlled from their
        respective buttons

Testing Modules using Porcu's Training Modded Modules

Round Keypads - Can easily select keypads and the VBox selection works well.

Bitwise - Most tests worked out with one press of the correct operator. I have to recheck the operations for NOT
        [NOTED ERR] - One NOT was incorrect, unsure as to why
        [POSSIBLE ISSUES] - Potentially missing a plate, confusing the module input with the minute input
        [SOLUTION] - Add nouns to indicate the quantity of which object is on the bomb
        [SOLUTION] - The reset manual method needs to reset inside data
        [ISSUE] - NOT seems to be the most error filled
        [SOLUTION] - MODULE AND MINUTE NUMBERS WEREN'T SET, adding a thrown exception for that

Emoji Math - Buttons are easy to press, The order to press them in is straight forward
        [TESTS FAILED] - =((:-:(:|, (:=)+:|)=, :|):+=(=(

Neutralization - Functionality is complete, GUI looks good
        [TESTS] - 12 Successful Modules, 2 Successful run-throughs (Porcu)
        [TESTS FAILED] (2/2, sc:pm1aj5, 1xParallel, 20 Blue),
                        (0/0, sc:qp5id6, 1xPS2, LitFRK, UnIND, UnTRN, 10 Blue: Wrong - 02, Off KOH)
                        (2/2, sc:ng1cc6, 1xRCA:RJ:PS, UnSIG, 10 Blue: Wrong - 02, Off KOH)
        [ISSUE] - Filtering vowel didn't account for uppercase
        [SOLUTION] - Added toLowerCase in ultimateFilter
        [TESTS PASSED POST] - 1 Centurion Mod
        [TESTS FAILED] (0/0, sc:2i0ib4 1 plate Lit IND, SIG 20oz Red: Wrong - 08, On, LiOH),
                       (3/2 sc:c22dw5, 1xDVI, 1xRJ-45 5oz Yellow - Numbers not showing up)
        [ISSUE] - Didn't deal with negative numbers for the acid concentration
        [SOLUTION] - Added a Math.abs() to the code to turn negatives positive
        [TESTS PASSED POST] - 5 Centurion Mod, 1 Porcu
        [TESTS FAILED] (3/2, sc:0j0sn1, 1xDVI,PS2, 1xSerial, UnSIG 20oz Red: Wrong - 32, On, LiOH
                                                                   10oz Red: Wrong - 16, On, LiOH)
        [ISSUE] - Something with Hydrogen bromide (Red)
        [SOLUTION] - Forgot the second condition for finding the base (This fixes the 4th failed test case,
                        but not 6 and 7)
        [SOLUTION] - Changing the || in the base concentration method back to &&. This switch was based on the idea
                     that if a > b but not c, then a <= c, which is incorrect for the module because we're finding
                     the largest of the 3 quantities
