# Gradle Centurion
### Intro
This is the Gradle implementation of the [Centurion Manual project](https://github.com/Ultraviolet-Ninja/The-Centurion), created with the intention of using Continuous Integration to test module solutions and data structures as the project progresses. This also has helped me understand how JavaFX, Gradle and Circle CI interact with each other.

### Technologies
- JDK 8
- Java FX - GUI
- Gradle - Automation Tool
- Circle CI - Test Automation
- Jacoco - Test Coverage Analysis
- CodeMR Free Trial - Coupling/Cohesion/Code Complexity Analysis

### Status
Currently, in progress\
